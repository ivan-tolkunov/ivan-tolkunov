### Hi! My name is Ivan Tolkunov.

I'm a software engineer with **5+ years of experience**. I'm passionate about *AI* and *Python*. I learn by building practical projects, check out my blog posts for more examples.

In 2024, I'm looking for a full-time or an internship position as a software engineer, preferably in AI space. Please get in touch via email or LinkedIn.
